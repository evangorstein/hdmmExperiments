This repository contains all scripts and notebooks required to reproduce the tables, figures, and other results fro "HighDimMixedModels.jl: Robust High Dimensional Mixed Models across Omics Data".


# Simulations

Simulated data for the gene expression, gwas, and microbiome experiments were generated by scripts `gen_data.jl`, `gen_data_gwas.jl` and `gen_data_OTU`, respectively, all found within `scripts`. The fitting of the high dimensional models was done with CHTC jobs--the code in files `scripts/experiment.jl` shows an outline of what those jobs did, iterating through each simulated dataset and fitting a model to each. Note that the original name for the fitting function was `lmmlasso`, but this has been changed in the package to `hdmm`.

## Processing and visualizing performance in simulations

The plots of simulation results found in the paper are all generated in `scripts/plot_results.Rmd`

# Real data analysis

Analysis of the real data sets is done in the scripts `scripts/real_*.jl`. The plots found in the paper visualizing the results are generated by these scripts.
